# Analysis
Here we do the analysis and visualization included in the paper, including the gene_cluster and length effect.

## Gene Cluster Analysis
We conduct the analysis on the hidden state of different models trained on species. We apply t-sne to reduce the dimensionality of the hidden state and visualize the clustering results. see [gene_cluster.ipynb](gene_cluster.ipynb) for details.

## Length Effect Analysis
We visualize the length effect on the different models on the dataset of species and promoter prediction task. see [performance_length.ipynb](performance_length.ipynb) for details.
